## Description
The Sales Price Prediction project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict product prices based on various features. The dataset includes the following features:

1. Item_Identifier: Unique product ID
2. Item_Weight: Weight of the product
3. Item_Fat_Content: Whether the product is low fat or not
4. Item_Visibility: The % of total display area allocated to the product
5. Item_Type: The category of the product
6. Item_MRP: Maximum Retail Price of the product
7. Outlet_Identifier: Unique store ID
8. Outlet_Establishment_Year: The year the store was established
9. Outlet_Size: The size of the store in terms of ground area
10. Outlet_Location_Type: The type of city where the store is located
11. Outlet_Type: Type of outlet (grocery store or supermarket)
12. Item_Outlet_Sales: Sales of the product in the store (outcome variable)

## Deployment
The model has been deployed using Streamlit, offering a user-friendly web interface for predicting sales prices. Users can input product details, and the model will provide sales price predictions based on the trained data.
